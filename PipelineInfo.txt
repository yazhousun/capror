Overview of Programs

1. Run NCBIgenomeBatchDownloadFasta
Note: To run NCBIgenomeBatchDownloadFasta, input the following parameters when running:
  accessionListFile: file path to a file containing NCBI accession numbers to be downloaded as FASTA formatted files. First column
  contains representative genomes and second column contains neighbor genomes.
  outputDirectory  : file path to a folder that will contain the to-be downloaded FASTA files
  batchSize        : [Optional] To indicate how many records to download in one batch. This must be an integer between 1 and 900.
Description: NCBIgenomeBatchDownloadFasta downloads FASTA genome data for a list of given genomes from the NCBI Nucleotide database
using the Entrez E-utility, EFetch. Genomes of a specified batch size will be collected/updated during one EFetch call. All genome
data are output to individual files that can be used for future analysis. The results files will have the syntax, 
accessionNumberWithVersion.TimeinMilliseconds.fasta, and it will be saved in the designated folder (Representatives or 
Neighbors) in the specified outputDirectory. 
Detailed process:
  1. Processes input parameters.
  2. Re-downloads the most recently downloaded file in both the Representatives and Neighbors folders in case of error during
  previous download.
  3. Updates Representatives folder.
    3a. Creates HashSet of Representative files in accessionListFile.
    3b. Creates HashSet of Representative files currently in Representatives directory.
    3c. Creates URL and sends eFetch calls with files that must be updated. 
    3d. Saves files in proper directory. 
    ** steps 3c and 3d may iterate multiple times depending on the batchSize and number of files that must be updated.
    3e. Outputs number of Representative genomes updated. 
  4. Updates Neighbors folder.
    4a. Creates HashSet of Neighbors files in accessionListFile.
    4b. Creates HashSet of Neighbors files currently in Neighbors directory.
    4c. Creates URL and sends eFetch calls with files that must be updated. 
    4d. Saves files in proper directory. 
    ** steps 4c and 4d may iterate multiple times depending on the batchSize and number of files that must be updated.
    4e. Outputs number of Neighbors genomes updated.
  5. Completes genome download.

2. Run MostRecentGenomeVersion
Note: To run MostRecentGenomeVersion, input the following parameters when running:
  genomeListDirectory  : file path to a directory containing all genomes to study in individual files (Exampe: Representatives
  or Neighbors directory)
  outputDirectory      : file path to a folder that will contain the file listing most recent versions.
  outputFileNamePrefix : custom prefix for the output file
Description: MostRecentGenomeVersion scans the genomeListDirectory to find the most current version for each accession number. This
program was created as an effort to combat issues that might arise during the running of CaprorKmerCounter if there are outdate 
versions of the same genome present in the directory. The output file will be saved in the specified outputDirectory with the syntax
outputFileNamePrefix.TimeinMilliseconds.currentVersions.txt. The file contains three tab delimited files with column 1 listing the 
accession number, column 2 listing the most recent version number, and column 3 listing the corresponding filename.
Detailed process:
  1. Processes input parameters. 
  2. Create two HashMaps. One maps the accession number to the corresponding version number, and one that maps the accession number to
  the filename of the most recent version.
  3. Scan all files in the genomeListDirectory and populate HashMaps.
  4. Print HashMap as three column list to output file. 

3. Run CaprorKmerCounter
Note: To run CaprorKmerCounter, input the following parameters when running:
  genomeListDirectory    : file path to a directory containing all genomes to study in individual files (Example: Representatives
  or Neighbors directory)
  mostRecentVersionsFile : file path to a file that contains a list of the most recent versions of each genome.
  outputDirectory        : file path to a folder that will contain the kmer results files
  kmerLength             : must be an integer between 1 and 15
  outputFileNamePrefix   : custom prefix for the output file
Description: CaprorKmerCounter scans the data obtained from running NCBIgenomeBatchDownloadFasta in kmers of the designated length. 
The most recent versions of each genome are scanned by accessing the mostRecentVersionsFile. A results file is generated which
contains an integer representing the number of genomes in the given file that contain a specific kmer (in both the forward and 
reverse strands). Kmers are assigned a unique index (not present in output) and the results are presented in ascending order by the
unique index value. The results file has the syntax outputfilenamePrefix.yyyymmdd.allKmers.kmerLengthbps.kcl. The kcl extension has 
been created to represent "kmer count list". File conflicts have been resolved by appending an integer to the end of the filename 
before the extension.
Detailed process:
  1. Processes input parameters.
  2. Scans all files to keep track of kmer occurence.
    2a. Scans one genome on one strand.
    2b. Scans same genome on reverse strand.
  3. Output file of kmer occurence count. 

4. Run CaprorKmerResultsAnalyzer
Note: To run CaprorKmerResultsAnalyzer, input the following parameters when running:
  kmerListFile     : file path to a file containing all kmers to study.
  outputDirectory  : file path to a folder that will contain the kmer results files.
  kmerLength       : must be an integer between 1 and 15. Must match the kmerListFile kmer value.
Description: CaprorKmerResultsAnalyzer scans the table obtained from running CaprorKmerCounter for a designated kmer length
and records the frequency at which kmers are present in genomes. A file is created with the syntax,
filenamePrefix.yyyymmdd.allKmers.kmerLengthbps.summary.txt where filenamePrefix.yyyymmdd is the name of the 
CaprorKmerCounter file from which the genome data has been collected. The file lists the number of kmers that appear in 
greater than 4,000 genomes, greater than 3,000 genomes, greater than 2,000 genomes, greater than 1,000 genomes, less than 10 genomes, 
less than 5 genomes, less than 3 genomes, and less than 2 genomes. The file will be saved in the designated output directory and 
file conflicts have been resolved by appending an integer to the end of the filename before the extension. Another group of 8 
tab-delimited files are created which contain the unique index of the kmer in the first column and the number of genomes they're 
present in is in the second column. They have the syntax filenamePrefix.yyyymmdd.allKmers.kmerLengthbps.filespecific.txt where
filespecific can be replaced by one of the following:
  - G4k : Greater than 4,000 genomes
  - G3k : Greater than 3,000 genomes
  - G2k : Greater than 2,000 genomes
  - G1k : Greater than 1,000 genomes
  - L2  : Less than 2 genomes
  - L3  : Less than 3 genomes
  - L5  : Less than 5 genomes
  - L10 : Less than 10 genomes
Detailed process:
  1. Processes input parameters.
  2. Scan kmerListFile and keep track of how many kmers are present in the specified ranges of occurences.
  3. Output summary file 

5. CaprorFullUniqueRegionFinder
Note: Currently CaprorFullUniqueRegionFinder is designed to only report the unique regions for one genome, but it can be modified to scan all recent genomes for unique regions. The parameters that will be need to when scannning all genomes are:
